Enrichen
========

Enrich your life.

A system to rapidly configure machines with your packages and settings.

# Dependencies

- `bash` (relies on `bash` features, for now)
- GNU userspace tools (for now)
- `curl` (to automatically obtain and update dependencies)
- `ssh`  (to be able to configure remote hosts)

# Project Status

Goal: [Aspirational Readme](https://github.com/acook/enrichen/blob/main/aspirational_README.markdown)

Enrichen currently exists as a loose collection of scripts extracted from several of my other projects.

The goal is to stop having those one-off scripts and be able to set up a command line user environment or server on any unix-y system in a single command.
